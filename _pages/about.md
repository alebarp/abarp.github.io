I am a Lecturer  (Assistant Professor) in the [Faculty of Mathematical & Physical Sciences](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/mathematical-physical-sciences-0) at UCL, and a member of the 
[Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/) research group. I teach the Statistical Machine Learning course.

My academic journey includes completing the MMathPhys course at the University of Warwick (which I highly recommend - Warwick Uni is the ideal prep to making the most of [London's opportunities](https://alebarp.github.io/dance/)), and then the oldest mathematics examination: [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~twk/PartIII.pdf) at the University of Cambridge (Downing College).
As we enter the large data sets era, there is a growing necessity to extend the boundaries of mathematical physics, both in terms of tools and mindset, beyond their traditional confines, in order to develop a foundational understanding of data sciences.
This motivated my doctoral research in statistics at Imperial College London and Postdoc at Cambridge, more specfically on numerical integration, Markov Chain Monte Carlo and statistical model inference, which aim to sample and approximate complex distributions (see my [thesis](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/84749/1/Barp-A-A-2020-PhD-Thesis.pdf) introducing the bracket-measure formalism).
For a couple of months I was a [senior research associate](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-associates/alessandro-barp) at the Alan Turing Institute, working on geometric deep learning and network science within the [Turing-Roche partnership](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership).
