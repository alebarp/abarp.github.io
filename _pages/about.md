I am a senior research associate at the Alan Turing Institute working on geometric statistics and deep learning as part of [Turing-Roche parthnership](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership).

I did the MMathPhys course at the University of Warwick and Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge. 
As we enter the large data sets era, it is increasingly important to understand the structure of data, such as its reduction, missingness, and how to incorporate misspecification, uncertatiny and domain knowledge in our models.
Hence I focused on statistics during my PhD at Imperial College London and Postdoc at Cambridge, more specfically on Markov Chain Monte Carlo and statistical inference whose aim is to sample and approximate complex distributions.
I now also work on geometric deep learning, which aims to gain a better understanding of the models we build using neural networks.
