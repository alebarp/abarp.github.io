I am a Lecturer in the department of [Statistical Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-statistical-science) at UCL.

My academic journey includes completing the MMathPhys course at the University of Warwick, and then Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge.
As we enter the large data sets era, there is a growing necessity to comprehend the structure of data, encompassing aspects like reduction, missing data handling, and the integration of misspecification, uncertainty, and domain knowledge into our models. 
This motivated my doctoral research in statistics at Imperial College London and Postdoc at Cambridge, more specfically on numerical integration, Markov Chain Monte Carlo and statistical model inference, which aim to sample and approximate complex distributions (see my [thesis](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/84749/1/Barp-A-A-2020-PhD-Thesis.pdf) introducing the bracket-measure formalism).
For a couple of months I was a [senior research associate](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-associates/alessandro-barp) at the Alan Turing Institute, working on geometric deep learning and network science within the [Turing-Roche partnership](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership).
