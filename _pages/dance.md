I love living in London, there are so many opportunities here to explore cultures and discover activities.
I personally try to do everyting, from Goth to Bollywood nights, from Improv comedy to Beach volley (yes you can beach volley in London).
If you are new to London, I recommend joining [Sportas](https://www.sportas.co.uk/), [Rueda Libre](https://ruedalibre.co.uk), [Hoopla](https://www.hooplaimpro.com/improv-comedy-club-london-bridge.html), and checking dance studios like [Base](https://www.basedancestudios.com) or [Danceworks](https://danceworks.com).

My favourite activity is dancing, including azonto, samba, afroheels, capoeira, kizomba, bollywood, salsa, rueda, bhangra, modern Jazz, and amapiano (we have a lot to learn from dancers in academia).
My favourite ones are afrohouse and kuduro. 
Many people have heard of kuduro through the song "Danza kuduro", but that has little to do with [kuduro](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jSwXVVQ1AVg).
You can read about the very interesting history of kuduro [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26410069).
To see what afrohouse looks like, check [Septzilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH5k5cNV88Q), who founded the Afrohouselab.
