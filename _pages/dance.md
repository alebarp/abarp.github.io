I love living in London, there are so many opportunities here to explore cultures and discover activities.
I personally try to do everyting, from Goth to Bollywood nights, from Improv comedy to Beach volley (yes you can in London, and I recommend joining [Sportas](https://www.sportas.co.uk/)).

My favourite activity is dancing, including azonto, samba, afroheels, capoeira, kizomba, bollywood, salsa, rueda, bhangra, modern Jazz, and amapiano.
My favourite dances are afrohouse and kuduro. Check the [afrohouselab](https://www.instagram.com/theafrohouselab/) which was founded by [Septzilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH5k5cNV88Q).
Many people have heard of kuduro through the song "Danza kuduro", but that has little to do with [kuduro](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jSwXVVQ1AVg).
You can read about the very interesting history of kuduro [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26410069).
