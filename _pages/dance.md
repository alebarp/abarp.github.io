I love living in London, there are so many opportunities here to explore cultures and discover activities.
I personally try to do everyting, from Goth to Bollywood nights, from Improv comedy to Beach volley (yes you can in London, and I recommend joining [Sportas](https://www.sportas.co.uk/)).

My main activity is dancing, including samba, afroheels, capoeira, azonto, kizomba, bollywood, salsa rueda, bhangra, amapiano.
My favourite dances are afrohouse and kuduro. Check the [afrohouselab](https://www.instagram.com/theafrohouselab/), and you can read about the very interesting history of kuduro [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26410069).
