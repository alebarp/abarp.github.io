It is exciting to see the rise of geometric tools across statistical and machine leanring methodologies, from sampling, to statistical inference, to understading the structure of data.
In particular all my work, deriving minimum discrepnacie estimators with theoretical guarantees, and numerical integration/sampling algorithms 
Despite this there is a profound scepticism among statisticnas towards geometry 

This is particularly surprising for people coming from physics, as physicists know the foundations

In my opinion, this scepticism arises primarily for two reasons
* geometric tools arising in statistics come from mathematics and physics, and intertwine statstical relevant notions with irrelevant ones from physics and mathematics. This makes it hard for statisticians to gain insights on these methods. For instance Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is often explained via abstract ideas coming from Hamiltonian mechanics and symplectic structures, that are often irrelevant to understanding HMC.
Moreover these tools, e.g., Wasserstein gradients or Langevin processes use notions from geometric measure theory, distributional calculus, and stochastic differential equations. These tools are incredibly hard to grasp for people that do not have a geometry training. For instance, the structure of SDEs is described by cocycles and second-order geometry. Yet, to quote Laurent Schwartz, there is no second-order calculus without tears. More precisely:
             "Meyer a intitulé son article "Géométrie stochastique sans larmes";
            je ne suis pas sûr qu’il n’y ait pas de larmes, mais suis à peu près sûr qu’il
            y en a dans le mien. Les larmes paraissent un peu inévitablement liées au calcul
            du second ordre ; on ne pleure pas au premier ordre, on pleure au second, depuis
            déjà des générations."
